- Each provider implements common interfaces
- Supports Stripe, Paddle, Lemon Squeezy, and Offline payments
- Provider-specific data stored in `*PaymentProviderData` models
- Webhooks handle provider callbacks

### Event-Driven Architecture
The application uses Laravel events for domain actions:
- **Order Events**: Order created, completed, failed
- **Subscription Events**: Created, updated, cancelled, renewed, trial started/ended
- **User Events**: Registered, verified, etc.
- Listeners handle side effects (emails, notifications, metrics)

## Coding Standards

### SaaSykit-Specific Conventions
- Services should be stateless and injected via dependency injection
- Use DTOs for complex data structures passed between layers
- Event/Listener pattern for side effects
- Filament for admin UI (avoid custom controllers when possible)
- Livewire for interactive frontend components
- Payment provider logic should be isolated in provider-specific classes
- All monetary amounts use the `Money` package
- Translations via `__()` function
- Use Spatie Permissions for authorization
- Queue long-running tasks (emails, webhooks, metrics)

### Database Conventions
- Use migrations for all schema changes
- Foreign keys with cascade/set null as appropriate
- Use proper indexes for performance
- Version history via `mpociot/versionable` where needed

### Testing Guidelines
- Feature tests for critical flows (subscription, checkout, payment)
- Unit tests for services with complex logic
- Use factories for test data
- Mock external services (payment providers, email)
- Run tests before committing: `vendor/bin/phpunit`

## Environment Setup

### First-Time Setup
```bash
composer install
npm install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
npm run dev
```

### Development Tools
- **Horizon Dashboard**: `/horizon` (queue monitoring)
- **Telescope Dashboard**: `/telescope` (debugging, dev only)
- **Admin Panel**: `/admin`
- **User Dashboard**: `/dashboard`

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Follow existing application Enum naming conventions.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== herd rules ===

# Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd at `https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test`. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate valid URLs. Never run commands to serve the site. It is always available.
- Use the `herd` CLI to manage services, PHP versions, and sites (e.g. `herd sites`, `herd services:start <service>`, `herd php:list`). Run `herd list` to discover all available commands.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allow to build dynamic, reactive interfaces in PHP without writing JavaScript.
- You can use Alpine.js for client-side interactions instead of JavaScript frameworks.
- Keep state server-side so the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions as you would in HTTP requests.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== phpunit/core rules ===

# PHPUnit

- This application uses PHPUnit for testing. All tests must be written as PHPUnit classes. Use `php artisan make:test --phpunit {name}` to create a new test.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When the tests relating to your feature are passing, ask the user if they would like to also run the entire test suite to make sure everything is still passing.
- Tests should cover all happy paths, failure paths, and edge cases.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files; these are core to the application.

## Running Tests

- Run the minimal number of tests, using an appropriate filter, before finalizing.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test --compact`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).

=== filament/filament rules ===

## Filament

- Filament is a Laravel UI framework built on Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS. UIs are defined in PHP via fluent, chainable components. Follow existing conventions in this app.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for official documentation on Artisan commands, code examples, testing, relationships, and idiomatic practices. If `search-docs` is unavailable, refer to https://filamentphp.com/docs.

### Artisan

- Always use Filament-specific Artisan commands to create files. Find available commands with the `list-artisan-commands` tool, or run `php artisan --help`.
- Inspect required options before running, and always pass `--no-interaction`.

### Patterns

Always use static `make()` methods to initialize components. Most configuration methods accept a `Closure` for dynamic values.

Use `Get $get` to read other form field values for conditional logic:

<code-snippet name="Conditional form field visibility" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

Select::make('type')
    ->options(CompanyType::class)
    ->required()
    ->live(),

TextInput::make('company_name')
    ->required()
    ->visible(fn (Get $get): bool => $get('type') === 'business'),

</code-snippet>

Use `Set $set` inside `->afterStateUpdated()` on a `->live()` field to mutate another field reactively. Prefer `->live(onBlur: true)` on text inputs to avoid per-keystroke updates:

<code-snippet name="Reactive field update" lang="php">
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

TextInput::make('title')
    ->required()
    ->live(onBlur: true)
    ->afterStateUpdated(fn (Set $set, ?string $state) => $set(
        'slug',
        Str::slug($state ?? ''),
    )),

TextInput::make('slug')
    ->required(),

</code-snippet>

Compose layout by nesting `Section` and `Grid`. Children need explicit `->columnSpan()` or `->columnSpanFull()`:

<code-snippet name="Section and Grid layout" lang="php">
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Details')
    ->schema([
        Grid::make(2)->schema([
            TextInput::make('first_name')
                ->columnSpan(1),
            TextInput::make('last_name')
                ->columnSpan(1),
            TextInput::make('bio')
                ->columnSpanFull(),
        ]),
    ]),

</code-snippet>

Use `Repeater` for inline `HasMany` management. `->relationship()` with no args binds to the relationship matching the field name:

<code-snippet name="Repeater for HasMany" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('institution')
            ->required(),
        TextInput::make('qualification')
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->columns(2),

</code-snippet>

Use `state()` with a `Closure` to compute derived column values:

<code-snippet name="Computed table column value" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->state(fn (User $record): string => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}"),

</code-snippet>

Use `SelectFilter` for enum or relationship filters, and `Filter` with a `->query()` closure for custom logic:

<code-snippet name="Table filters" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options(UserStatus::class),

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->relationship('author', 'name'),

Filter::make('verified')
    ->query(fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereNotNull('email_verified_at')),

</code-snippet>

Actions are buttons that encapsulate optional modal forms and behavior:

<code-snippet name="Action with modal form" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('updateEmail')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->email()
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->action(fn (array $data, User $record) => $record->update($data)),

</code-snippet>

### Testing

Testing setup (requires `pestphp/pest-plugin-livewire` in `composer.json`):

- Always call `$this->actingAs(User::factory()->create())` before testing panel functionality.
- For edit pages, pass `['record' => $user->id]`, use `->call('save')` (not `->call('create')`), and do not assert `->assertRedirect()` (edit pages do not redirect after save).

<code-snippet name="Table test" lang="php">
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(ListUsers::class)
    ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
    ->searchTable($users->first()->name)
    ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(1))
    ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->skip(1));

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Create resource test" lang="php">
use function Pest\Laravel\assertDatabaseHas;

livewire(CreateUser::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'name' => 'Test',
        'email' => 'test@example.com',
    ])
    ->call('create')
    ->assertNotified()
    ->assertHasNoFormErrors()
    ->assertRedirect();

assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
    'name' => 'Test',
    'email' => 'test@example.com',
]);

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Edit resource test" lang="php">
livewire(EditUser::class, ['record' => $user->id])
    ->fillForm(['name' => 'Updated'])
    ->call('save')
    ->assertNotified()
    ->assertHasNoFormErrors();

assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
    'id' => $user->id,
    'name' => 'Updated',
]);

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing validation" lang="php">
livewire(CreateUser::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'name' => null,
        'email' => 'invalid-email',
    ])
    ->call('create')
    ->assertHasFormErrors([
        'name' => 'required',
        'email' => 'email',
    ])
    ->assertNotNotified();

</code-snippet>

Use `->callAction(DeleteAction::class)` for page actions, or `->callAction(TestAction::make('name')->table($record))` for table actions:

<code-snippet name="Calling actions" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;

livewire(ListUsers::class)
    ->callAction(TestAction::make('promote')->table($user), [
        'role' => 'admin',
    ])
    ->assertNotified();

</code-snippet>

### Correct Namespaces

- Form fields (`TextInput`, `Select`, `Repeater`, etc.): `Filament\Forms\Components\`
- Infolist entries (`TextEntry`, `IconEntry`, etc.): `Filament\Infolists\Components\`
- Layout components (`Grid`, `Section`, `Fieldset`, `Tabs`, `Wizard`, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\`
- Schema utilities (`Get`, `Set`, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\`
- Table columns (`TextColumn`, `IconColumn`, etc.): `Filament\Tables\Columns\`
- Table filters (`SelectFilter`, `Filter`, etc.): `Filament\Tables\Filters\`
- Actions (`DeleteAction`, `CreateAction`, etc.): `Filament\Actions\`. Never use `Filament\Tables\Actions\`, `Filament\Forms\Actions\`, or any other sub-namespace for actions.
- Icons: `Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon` enum (e.g., `Heroicon::PencilSquare`)

### Common Mistakes

- **Never assume public file visibility.** File visibility is `private` by default. Always use `->visibility('public')` when public access is needed.
- **Never assume full-width layout.** `Grid`, `Section`, `Fieldset`, and `Repeater` do not span all columns by default.
- **Use `Select::make('author_id')->relationship('author', 'name')` for BelongsTo fields.** `BelongsToSelect` does not exist in v4.
- **`Repeater` uses `->schema()`, not `->fields()`.**
- **Never add `->dehydrated(false)` to fields that need to be saved.** It strips the value from form state before `->action()` or the save handler runs. Only use it for helper/UI-only fields.
- **Use correct property types when overriding `Page`, `Resource`, and `Widget` properties.** These properties have union types or changed modifiers that must be preserved:
  - `$navigationIcon`: `protected static string | BackedEnum | null` (not `?string`)
  - `$navigationGroup`: `protected static string | UnitEnum | null` (not `?string`)
  - `$view`: `protected string` (not `protected static string`) on `Page` and `Widget` classes
